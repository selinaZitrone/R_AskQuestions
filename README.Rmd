# Common error messages and problems

Here are some of the most common errors that R beginners have to face:

**1. Version of R or RStudio are too old**

  - Error message: `Package is not compatible with your version or RStudio`
  - Solution: Update R or RStudio to the newest version

**2. Syntax errors**

  - They are usually easy to find by reading the error message
  - Common errors: forgot a comma, closing bracket is missing, ...
  
**3. R could not find function**

  - Error message: `R could not find function ...`
  - Check if the package that contains the function is installed and loaded
  - Check if the function name is written correctly. Did you e.g. write 
  `lenght(1:10)` instead of `length(1:10)`?

**4. Functions are masked**

 - There are some packages that have functions using the same name as functions
 in base R or in other packages. 
 If you load one of these packages you will get a warning, telling you that a function 
 is masked by a function from another package. If you call a masked function,
 the one from the package that was attached last  will be used.
  - Example: If you load the package `dplyr`, you will get the following warning:
 
 `The following objects are masked from ‘package:stats’: filter, lag`
 
   - To be clear which function you mean in this case, tell R which 
 package it comes from:
  If you want to use the function filter, don't just call `filter()` but call 
  `stats::filter()` or `dplyr::filter()` to be clear about which filter function you mean. 
  
**5. Missing objects**

- Error message: `Error: object 'a' not found`
- Check if the object name is correct (any typos?, capitalization?, ...)
- Check if you are missing `"` or `'` anywhere: 
  - Example: If you want to create a character vector you have to call `c('a','b','c')` 
  and not `c(a,b,c)`

**6. Wrong data format**

- Does not necessarily trigger an error message, but results/plots are looking wrong.
- Are the data imported correctly?
  - E.g. R sometimes automatically converts strings to factors when reading data.
- Check if your data has the right format with
  - `str(data)` (This is very useful: always check that if something goes wrong with your data analysis)
  - `class(data)`
  - `head(data)`
  - `summary(data)`
  
**7. R crashes**

 - Sometimes R crashes and you have to restart R
 - Be sure to save your scripts regularly!
 
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/R_Crash.png"))
```
 
**8. The console only prints `+`**

- Every time you try to execute a new statement the console only prints `+` but does not execute the statement
- Problem is that there are more open than closed brackets in your code. Therefore R is waiting for more input until all brackets are closed.
- Solution: Go to the console and hit Escape. Then you will see the `>` sign again which means that R is ready for new input. 
- Before you execute new code, look for missing closing brackets in your code (usually this is already indicated with a red x on the left side of your script in RStudio).

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here::here("images/Console_plus.png"))
```

**9. Warnings**

- Sometimes R warns you that your code produced a number of warnings, that you can
read by calling the function `warnings()` in the console. 
- Warnings do not always mean that you did something wrong. You also get warnings if you
have NA values in your data, if a function is deprecated, ...
- It is however important to read the warnings, understand them and only continue
if you are sure that they don't mean that something in your code is wrong.


# What to do if you get stuck with R

It's normal to get stuck on a problem where you need help from someone. Don't worry!
The course forum (and other online forums) are the perfect place to ask your question.
However, it is important to follow some guidelines for problem solving and question 
asking to make the whole experience more pleasant and productive.

Please read the following guide to get an idea of how to trouble-shoot R problems and where and how to get the best help.
Also have a look at the file `Example.R` from this repository. You can download this script and try it out yourself.

## 1. Read the R documentation before you ask

Often, questions about how to use a particular function are solved by just 
reading the doc. To bring up the doc for a function in R, type ? followed by the 
function name to check the doc for the function, e.g.:

```{r eval=FALSE}
?mean # or
help(mean)
```

Some special functions start with a symbol instead of an alphabet. In such cases, 
wrap the function in backticks ``. e.g., to check the doc for the [ function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
?`[`
help(`[`)
```

## 2. Look for the answer on the web

Learning how to search for an answer on the internet is arguably one of the most important
problem solving skills when programming. In most (if not all) cases, you are not 
the first one having a specific problem and others already posted questions about it on
forums such as [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). You just need to learn how to formulate
a question and you will find the correct answer within the first hits from your search
engine of choice.

So before asking on a forum yourself, try looking for an answer online. 

### Tips for searching

- If you got an error or warning search with keywords: R + function name + error message
- If you don't know how to do something in R try searching
  - "How to ...", e.g. "R ggplot how to change axis title"
- Use RStudio and R in English. Then can easily copy and paste the error message
from the console to your search engine and find answers
    - calling `Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE='en')` in the console should do the trick and change
    your messages to English
- Always search in English to get much more answers

## 3. How to ask a good question?

If you didn't find the answer with any of the above mentioned methods, you can ask
a question on a forum so that others can help you.
You should ask your questions as clear as possible to minimize guesswork and make
answering easy and effective.

To achieve this, a good question should contain the following:

- **A clear problem statement**: Provide all necessary details. 
What are you trying to do? What have you tried that didn't work? 
What is your expected output?
- **A minimal data set** to demonstrate the problem
  - smallest data set necessary to reproduce the problem
  - Don't describe your data without providing it! 
- **A minimal runnable** code to reproduce the error/problem
  - All relevant code that everyone can just copy and paste into their R console 
  and run with minimal modification.
- if necessary: information on the used packages, R version and system
- if you have a function with random processes: a fixed seed before your example starts 
(fix seeds by calling set.seed() function)

## 4. R can help you to ask a good question!

Luckily, there are nice R functions that help you create a reproducible
example of your problem/question including data, plots and error messages that ensure
that everyone can copy your example and rerun it in their own R sessions to see
the problem for themselves.

Learning how to use these functions will make question asking and answering much
easier. Reproducible examples are key to getting your questions answered fast, therefore
it is worth to learn how to produce them from the very beginning.

### Include a minimal dataset

The easiest way to share your data is by using the dput command. 

Basic:

- Copy and paste the output of `dput(<your_data>)`

More advanced (if your data is too large for dput):

- Create a gist with dput in it and provide the link (e.g. on Github, more info [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/creating-gists))
- Create a pastebin with dput in it and provide the link

**Example**

Assume you are using the built-in data set `mtcars` for your analysis. If you want 
to provide others with code that reproduces this data set, you can use `dput`.
The output code of `dput` can be copy-pasted to any R session to reproduce the 
data set. If your data set is large, try to provide the minimum necessary to reproduce
your problem. E.g. provide a subset with fewer columns and fewer rows.

```{r}
# This is how the data looks like
mtcars[1:5, 1:2]

# get code that generates the first five lines and first two columns your data set
dput(mtcars[1:5, 1:2])
```

### Create an example with runnable code using the `reprex` package


The reprex package helps you turn your code into reproducible examples.

**Why should you use this package?**

Because
- you never have to copy paste code from the RStudio Console again
- you don't have to do the code formatting in another program
- talking about code is more productive when:
  - code actually runs: it's annoying to fix the code before answering the question
  - code does not have to be run: people can often already see the mistake from code and
  output without running it themselves
  - code can easily be run

**In which situations is this helpful?**

- When asking a question on a forum, Stack Overflow, GitHub, ...
- When asking a colleague or friend about some code issues that you have
- When you want to paste R code in a highlighted and formatted form somewhere else

**How to do this?**

Before you get started, first (install) and load the `reprex` package (Consider adding reprex to your RStudio profile if you use it more often. Then you don't have to load it every time you need it)

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("reprex")
library(reprex)
```

Assume your code looks like this and you want to know why the output is strange

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- factor("a")
y <- factor("b")
c(x,y)

```

You can simply copy the code from your R script to the clipboard and then call the `reprex()`
function in the console. Then will then see the output in the Viewer Pane of R Studio or in the
browser. What also happened is, that the content of your clipboard changed. If you now
paste the content of your clipboard somewhere, you will see that it is formatted 
as markdown, including the code, but also the console output that it created.
This can now be be pasted into your question e.g. on Github.

Not all platforms support this kind of markdown syntax and you can specify to 
which platform the output of reprex should be tuned to by using the `venue` argument.

Those are some of the options:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# GitHub (default) (this is also good for Discord, you only have to remove the white space between 
# the backticks and the r)
# you can also include your session info with si = TRUE
reprex(mean(rnorm(100)),
       venue = "gh",
       si = TRUE)

# Stack Overflow (this is also not bad for Discord)
reprex(mean(rnorm(100)),
       venue = "so")

# commented R script (good for email or slack)
reprex(mean(rnorm(100)),
       venue = "r")

# raw html
reprex(mean(rnorm(100)),
       venue = "html")

# as an rtf (experimental, so far only really works on mac because you need the command line
# tool highlight installed)
# but it's perfect to create code snippets e.g. for powerpoint etc
# you can exclude the advertisement for reprex with advertise = F
# see also here if you want to use it (on Mac) https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/rtf.html
reprex(mean(rnorm(100)),
       venue = "rtf",
       advertise = FALSE
       )
```

If the code you want to talk about includes figures reprex is even more useful. 
Assume your code looks like this:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(cars, aes(x=dist, y=speed)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

If you now copy this code to the clipboard, call `reprex()` and paste it, you will 
see that the image was added to the markdown output. You can now post this somewhere
and the image will already be included. No need to add a png, make a screenshot or 
let people you want help from run the code themselves to see the output.

You can also provide the example directly as an input argument to `reprex()` 
without copying to the clipboard before, e.g.

```{r eval = FALSE}
reprex({
  x <- rnorm(100)
  y <- rnorm(100)
  cor(x,y)
})
```
If you now call this, your rendered reprex will be on your clipboard and can be pasted somewhere.

**So which setup should be chosen for the discussion forum in Blackboard?**

Unfortunately, neither the blackboard forum nor the Webex meetings chat does support
markdown formatting. 
If you use the forum, Webex chat or Email to share your code I therefore suggest to use
`venue = "r"`. This does not support syntax highlighting and does not include plots 
but it ensures that all the output of your code is included.

So a concrete example would be: 

```{r eval=F}
# This includes the session info and does not show the rendered reprex locally 
reprex(venue="r",show=FALSE, si=TRUE)
```

If you want to include a plot in your reproducible example, I suggest you use `venu = "html"`.
So something like:

```{r eval=F}
reprex(venue="html",show=FALSE, si=TRUE)
```

A link to the image is included in the html and the plot will be shown below your 
code in the forum.

In the blackboard forum, you can include html code by clicking on the little `HTML button`
in the editor. If you don't see this button, you have to expand your toolbar, by clicking on the
two arrows on the right.
If you click on the HTML button, a window opens, where your post is shown in html format.
Your can just past your reproducible example in there after inserting a new line.


#### Addins

If you install the reprex package, you will find two Addins (in the top row of RStudio, right below Help). 
There is the addin `Reprex selection`. If you click this, the code that is currently 
highlighted by your mouse will be turned into a reprex. You can also bind this to a 
keyboard shortcut then you neither have to click this button nor call a function to 
create a reprex (under `Tools -> Modify Keyboard Shortcuts`).
You can also highlight code and then use the Addin `Render reprex` which lets you 
specify source of the reprex, target venue etc.

#### The other way around with `reprex_clean()`

If you copy some code e.g. from Stack Overflow and paste it into your R session to run it, 
you can do it the other way around. Copy the code (including comments of the answer) 
to the clipboard and run `reprex_clean()`. Now you can paste the clean code into your R-Script.

## 5. Some words on code style

If you share your code with others, it's important that it is formatted in a readable 
way following good practice standards. There are different standards around, and
this is not the place to talk about them. I just want to note, that there is a 
R package called `styler` which can apply different code style standards to your code.

It provides functions to style a section of your code, a whole file or even an
entire directory. I suggest you install and have a look at the package with

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("styler")
library(styler)
?`styler-package`
```

When you installed the package, there is also a addin that you can use to format your code.
You can select the code you want to style with the mouse, got to `Addins->Style Selection`
and voilà, your code is styled nicely.
By default, styler uses the style guide of the tidyverse (see [here](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for more info)
which is a pretty common and well thought through standard. So you can just leave it like that.

### Use styler on your reprex

If you don't want to style the code in your script, you should definitely consider
styling the reproducible example that you provide. Fortunately, there is an argument 
`style` that you can pass into the reprex function that does that for you.

```{r eval=FALSE}
reprex(venue="r", show=FALSE, si=TRUE, style=TRUE)
```

Like that, the reprex on your clipboard will be styled according to the tidyverse
style guide.
